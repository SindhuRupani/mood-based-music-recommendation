This project focuses on understanding mood patterns by analyzing a dataset containing factors such as mood, study time, sleep hours, phone usage, stress levels, and productivity. Using Python in Google Colab, the data is cleaned, explored, and visualized to identify meaningful relationships. Multiple visualizations such as countplots, histograms, scatter plots, violin plots, boxplots, KDE plots, pairplots, pie charts, line graphs, and a correlation heatmap are used to gain insights. The analysis reveals how lifestyle behaviors influence mood—for example, individuals with higher sleep hours tend to show better moods, excessive phone usage increases stress and reduces productivity, and study time often correlates positively with productivity. The project uses Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations. Overall, this project aims to understand how daily habits affect emotional well-being and provides a strong foundation for future extensions such as building mood-prediction machine learning models or interactive dashboards.
